#  ByteCoin

### Our Goal
The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills you learned in the Clima tutorial and make a Bitcoin price reporter. We are going to revisit how to use URLSession to make HTTP requests and JSONDecoder for JSON parsing. This will be the most advanced challenge you will face to date. We believe in you!



### What you will create
Weâ€™re going to make a Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.


### Reminder
In your ByteCoin folder add a file called Constants.swift. The file should look like this:
```
let coinApiKey = "INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE"
```
